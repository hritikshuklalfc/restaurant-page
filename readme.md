# 🍔 Food Munch
> *A fully responsive, high-performance landing page for a modern food delivery service.*

## 📋 Overview
This project is a static frontend website designed to showcase a food delivery brand. It features a modern grid layout, mobile-first responsive design, and interactive UI elements.

While the core structure is based on the popular "Food Munch" curriculum, I have significantly **refactored the code** and added **custom animations** to enhance the user experience.
